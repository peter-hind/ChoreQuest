# ChoreQuest!
## An app for Parents to put their kids to work doing tasks around the house!

The project allows parents to create chores and rewards worth (fairly arbitrary) points values. The kids can then take on the tasks, earn the points, and claim the rewards!

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 - First time users create and avatar and a family

🙆🏻‍♀️ - Other family members then join that family

👩‍👦 - Users are separated as either Parent or Child - Parent has admin roles

🙎🏻‍♂️ - Parents can create chores and rewards

🧒🏻 - Kids can take on chores and claim rewards - but parental approval is required!

💏 - Parents can assign chores directly if necessary (in case the chore is... boring 😒)

## The Future
### Issues and Updates

This project was originally developed under a 5 day time constraint. Believe it or not, it doesn't yet have all the functionality we want! The following updates are in the pipeline:

* React Native rebuild for mobile applications
* Multiple Avatar sets
* Reward and chore editing
* Confirmation modals for important choices
* Shared Family options
* Chore urgency for points bonus
* Diminishing returns on regularly completed chores

#### Bugs

We are aware of some issues logging in / signing up on certain browsers, and are working to fix the problems.
Given the quick nature of the product, some of the codebase is in need of major overhaul/refactoring, which we will undertake as we implement new features.
